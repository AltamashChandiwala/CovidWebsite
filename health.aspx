				<h4>Green Leafy Vegetables</h4>
				<p>Green leafy vegetables have always been the major source of nutrition. Vegetables like broccoli, peas, capsicum, spinach and other seasonal variants are a great source of vitamin C, healthy fats, fibres and iron. If you are already recovering from the infection, having broth and soup would make recovery easier for you.</p>

				<h4>Fruits</h4>
				<p>Fruits offer you a dose of healthy glucose, dietary fibre, vitamin C and many antiviral nutrients. Also, citrus fruits like oranges, grapes, help hydrate the body. Staying hydrated is very important if you are hoping to avoid this infection or fight the symptoms. Including fruits in your daily snacks helps to keep your hunger pangs at bay and provide you with immunity-boosting nutrients.</p>

				<h4>Seeds And Nuts</h4>
				<p>Seeds and nuts are rich sources of selenium, zinc, protein and vitamin E, B6. etc. Nuts like almonds, Brazil nuts, walnuts, etc., are also good sources for protein if you are a vegetarian. Pumpkin, flax and chia seeds provide you with phytochemicals like antioxidants.</p>

				<h4>Dairy Products</h4>
				<p>Dairy products like milk, yoghurt, butter, ghee, etc., also add to your nutrition needs. The butyric acid found in clarified butter (ghee) is a short-chain fatty acid known to provide instant energy to the body without raising blood sugar levels. and is also known to feed good bacteria in the gut that supports the immune system by killing pathogens and neutralising toxins in the digestive tract, not allowing them to enter the circulation to cause damage in the body. Dairy products are also good sources of calcium and vitamin D. If you are fighting Omicron already, yoghurt will be the most nutritious option for you.It is a probiotic. Meaning, it improves your digestion and aids the generation of healthy gut bacteria.</p>

				<h4>Beverages With Electrolytes</h4>
				<p>"Fluids are important," says Dr. Bob. "It's always good to make sure there are some electrolytes—particularly if you have diarrhea and you're vomiting. If you have electrolytes—which 'Electral', 'Ensure' provides and other nutritional drinks—you're not running low on potassium and your sodium levels stay normal."</p>

				<h4>Other Foods</h4>
				<p>You should also include other power-packed foods like mushrooms, fish, eggs in your diet. These foods offer unique rare minerals important for a healthy immune system.</p>
